When running programs on a workstation, most of the time you can simply execute `./a.out` and wait for the results. On most HPC clusters, you must use a "batch scheduler" to request one or more compute nodes to run on and a "job launcher" to execute your program on the compute node(s) you were allocated. You submit jobs on Summit with IBM's [`jsrun` job launcher](../jsrun_Job_Launcher).

We recommend using this Challenge in conjunction with the [`jsrun` Job Launcher](../jsrun_Job_Launcher) challenge.
